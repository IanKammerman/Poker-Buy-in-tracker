# Poker Buy-ins Tracker

A minimal static web app to track poker game buy-ins, rebuys, cash outs, and totals. Data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`.

## Notes

- All data stays on your machine; no server.

## Development

No build step needed. Files:

- `index.html` — markup and structure
- `styles.css` — styling
- `app.js` — logic and persistence

Works offline.
